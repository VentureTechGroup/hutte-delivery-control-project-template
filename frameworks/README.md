# Hutte Frameworks Collection

Draft - WIP - This document must explain what the purpose behind these frameworks and other important considerations.

- Providing the baseline of frameworks that are typically used in development
- Not providing a dml manager as salesforce released user mode
- These can be individually installed as unlocked package, however Hutte provides all-in-one as a curated recommended collection. Besides, Hutte framework shows these in a folder so the developer can see these in the repository without having to retrieve the unlocked packages.
